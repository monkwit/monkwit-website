                    <h2>Pain is a choice. And if you learn this, your life will change.</h2>
                    <p>Not the first sting.</p>
                    <p>Not the raw sensation.</p>
                    <p>But the second wave&mdash;your resistance, your reaction, your refusal to feel it.</p>
                    <p>That part? That&rsquo;s optional.</p>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t learn this in a book.</p>
                    <p>I learned it while sitting cross-legged on a cushion, wanting to scream.</p>
                    <p>Day three of a five-day silent retreat.</p>
                    <p>My shoulders felt like they&rsquo;d fused into concrete.</p>
                    <p>Every second of meditation was a battle.</p>
                    <p>I tried everything&mdash;stretching, rolling, twisting, adjusting.</p>
                    <p>Temporary relief. Then more pain.</p>
                    <p>The harder I fought, the worse it got.</p>
                    <p>I was trapped in a loop: tension, reaction, frustration, repeat.</p>
                    <p>And then something strange happened.</p>
                    <p>I stopped.</p>
                    <p>Not because I wanted to.</p>
                    <p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t keep fighting.</p>
                    <p>The big idea hit me like a bell in an empty temple:</p>
                    <p><strong>Pain multiplies when you resist it.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Suffering isn&rsquo;t the sensation&mdash;it&rsquo;s the story.</strong></p>
                    <p>So I stopped trying to fix it.</p>
                    <p>I sat, still and unflinching.</p>
                    <p>And I said: &ldquo;Welcome, pain. You&rsquo;re allowed to be here.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t serve it tea.</p>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t roll out a mat and ask it to stay.</p>
                    <p>I simply let it exist.</p>
                    <p>And something shifted.</p>
                    <p><strong>Relief didn&rsquo;t come from escape.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>It came from expansion.</strong></p>
                    <p>I stopped letting the pain fill my awareness.</p>
                    <p>Instead, I noticed the sound of birds.</p>
                    <p>The breath in my lungs.</p>
                    <p>The warmth in my hands.</p>
                    <p>The pain shrank&mdash;not because it left, but because it was no longer the whole story.</p>
                    <p>It was just one wave in a sea of sensation.</p>
                    <p><strong>You can use this everywhere.</strong></p>
                    <p>Physical pain.</p>
                    <p>Emotional mess.</p>
                    <p>Anxious loops.</p>
                    <p>Awkward conversations.</p>
                    <p>All of them.</p>
                    <p>Step one: notice your resistance.</p>
                    <p>Step two: welcome the feeling.</p>
                    <p>Step three: expand your awareness.</p>
                    <p>Step four: stop serving it tea.</p>
                    <p>Let it stay, but don&rsquo;t let it rule.</p>
                    <p><strong>You&rsquo;ll feel a kind of quiet power.</strong></p>
                    <p>Not because you conquered pain.</p>
                    <p>But because you stopped being afraid of it.</p>
                    <p>You gave up the war.</p>
                    <p>You became space itself.</p>
                    <p><strong>Try it next time life gets loud:</strong></p>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t fight the feeling.</p>
                    <p>Welcome it.</p>
                    <p>Let it float in your awareness like a leaf on a lake.</p>
                    <p>Watch what happens.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recap:</strong></p>
                    <p>Pain isn&rsquo;t the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Your resistance is.</p>
                    <p>So:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Welcome what hurts.</li>
                        <li>Expand your awareness.</li>
                        <li>Stop giving attention to what doesn&rsquo;t deserve it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This isn&rsquo;t passivity.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s precision.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s peace by practice.</p>
                    <p>And if you want to live like that&mdash;start with your attention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
                    <p>Most people overthink their productivity.</p>
                    <p>They resist their reality.</p>
                    <p>They try to optimize away discomfort.</p>
                    <p>But real clarity&mdash;and the power to be more productive&mdash;comes from letting go, not layering on.</p>
                    <p>That&rsquo;s the philosophy behind <strong>monkwit</strong>.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s not a list of hacks.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s not a cult of control.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s a reminder: stop managing your mind like a spreadsheet.</p>
                    <p>Capture what matters. Let go of the rest.</p>
                    <p>You don&rsquo;t need more structure.</p>
                    <p>You need more space.</p>
                    <p>Start over. Suffer less. Act when it matters.</p>
                    <p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
                    <p>Not just productivity.</p>
                    <p>Presence. And that&rsquo;s how to change your life.</p>
